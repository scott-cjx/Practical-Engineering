## Schematic Design

There are 2 main types (purpose) of schematics
1. Architectural <br>
    → Maps the connections between boards
2. for PCB <br>
    → Maps the connection within a board.

## Architectural

- Symbol Desginators: `Generally not required`
- use of buses: a connection that connects multiple nets.
- Abstracts the internal connectections within boards (internal workings of a board is NOT **shown**)
- Clear sections of boards

    → takes into account of packaging (locations of boards)

## for PCB
- Symbol Designators: `Required + clearly and logically placed` <br>
    → designators should be structured (increasing based on x vs y)
- Heavy use of **labels** 
- Clear Sections based on components + type of connections <br>
    → Power (high/ low)<br>
    → Signal (fast/ slow)
- Sections using boxes & pages (sheets)

## Aesthetics
Aesthetics of schematic diagrams plays a big role in readablilty and maintance of schemtics; regardless the type of schematic diagram.

Some factors that will help ease maintance and understanding of a schematic diagram include:
- Clear and uniformed sectioning of components (functional blocks)
- Use of "correct" and standard symbols
- Clear and "correct" annotation of symbol and connections
- Standarization of connections
